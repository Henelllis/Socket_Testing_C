Sockets are the low level endpoint used for processing information across a network
Common Networking Protocols like HTTP, and FTP rely on sockets to make underneath to make connections 

TCP low level network prot
HTTP high level network prot

The client socket is created with a socket() call
And the connected to a remote address with the connect() call
and finally can retreive data with the recv() call

CLIENT SOCKET SHIT
socket() -> connect() -> recv()
